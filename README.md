> A chaotic-good blog by a senior CS student who still Googles "How to commit" more often than she'd like to admit.

Hi, I’m Sia. I’m allegedly in my final year of a Computer Science degree, but spiritually I’m still debugging print statements and asking ChatGPT why my `git` repo is mad at me.

This is my blog where I try to untangle:
- 💻 Tech things (badly, but persistently)
- 📚 My learning journey as an AI/multimodal research minion
- ❤️ Dating and life disasters (also badly, but with more memes)
- 🎨 Hobbies, weird thoughts, and side quests I accidentally commit to
